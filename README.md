# Day Scheduler 

## Description

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Day.js in the browser.

## Lessons Learned

While attempting this project, my goal was to implement features such as saving to LocalStorage, time intervals, and dynamically update my webpage.
Through this project, I was also able to traverse the DOM with more ease and gained a deeper understanding of how to create, set variables, and append these elements by using Javascript.
