# Day Scheduler 

## Description

Through this project, I will try to apply our lessons using JQuery and Bootstrap. Additionally, Third-Party-APIs such as Day.js were used in order to build upon the functionality of the website. By using this resource, I can add current date and time - making the Scheduler a responsive app that updates throughout the day. Continuing, from previous projects, is the use of LocalStorage in order to save the user's inputs. This allows them to save their activities within the text area and view them again even after leaving or closing the web page.
